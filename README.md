# Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)

This repository contains **Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)** written from a
**Product Manager’s perspective**.

Each PRD focuses on:
- Clear problem framing
- User and business impact
- Metrics-driven decision making
- Trade-offs and constraints
- Execution-ready thinking

These documents are not theoretical exercises — they are derived from
real product analysis, teardowns, and practical PM workflows.

## What these PRDs cover

Each PRD typically includes:
- Problem statement and context
- Goals and non-goals
- User personas and journeys
- Key insights and assumptions
- Proposed solutions and experiments
- Success metrics and guardrails
- Risks, trade-offs, and open questions
- Rollout considerations

The emphasis is on **clarity and decision quality**, not exhaustive specifications.

## Why this repository exists

As a Product Manager, PRDs are a primary tool to:
- Translate insights into execution
- Align stakeholders on intent and outcomes
- Make trade-offs explicit
- Enable engineering and design teams to move with confidence

This repository serves as a public record of how I structure,
reason about, and communicate product decisions.

- Assumptions are called out where data is not available
- Scope is intentionally constrained to keep execution realistic

Feedback and discussion are always welcome.
